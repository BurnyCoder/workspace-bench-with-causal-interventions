# TODO

Live checklist for the basic-evals and baselines work (Agam). One PR per line; smoke a few
items before any scale run. Status: [ ] open · [~] in PR · [x] merged.

## Foundation
- [x] pydra CLI (`wsbench <command> key=value`), merged 2026-09-16 (#9).

## Basic evals, single token (desideratum 1) — bank judge; DM has its own judge
- [x] association (merged 2026-09-16, #16)
- [x] basic-readout (merged 2026-09-16, #16)
- [x] multihop (merged 2026-09-16, #16)
- [x] multilingual (merged 2026-09-16, #16)
- [x] poetry (merged 2026-09-16, #16)
- [x] typo (merged 2026-09-16, #16)
- [x] directed_modulation (#17)

## Basic evals, multi-token (desideratum 2) — forced-choice Gemini judge per unit, conjunctive
- [x] multihop_mt (#20)
- [x] multilingual_mt (#20)
- [x] typo_mt (#20)
- [x] basic_readout_mt (#20)
- [x] multilingual_typo (#20)
- [x] multilingual_multihop (#20)
- [x] multi_concept_directed_modulation (#21)

## Baselines
- [x] lucky guessing (judge shown only the option lists; blind / described / uniform), Gemini (#22)
- [x] prompt-only (stock Qwen summary, scored by each family's own instrument at one layer; 13
      families, multi_concept_directed_modulation excluded) (#22)
- [ ] per-family empirical nulls (later)

## Methods (readout files, judged here; generation stays in global-workspace)

## Computational / programmatic evals (after the baselines; confirm the plan with Agam first)
Order (Agam, 2026-09-16): chained intermediates, brew intermediates, then buggy code, arithmetic
last. Confirmed 2026-09-16: brew judged on emission + stir cells only (check the cut against the
full-grid numbers first); buggy code Gemini judge only, no deterministic checker (pairwise blind
pick, chance 0.5, plus net_S2); arithmetic gets a Gemini judge too (the numeric matcher caught
too many false positives); prompt-only is not shown for multi_concept_directed_modulation.
- [ ] chained_intermediates
- [ ] brew_intermediates
- [ ] buggy_code
- [ ] arithmetic_intermediates — Gemini judge; variants (Agam, 2026-09-16): KEEP absval, addmul,
      floordiv, frac, fracadd, fraccomp, fracint, fracsmall, muladd, mulmid, sign, signpair, subsub,
      subsubx; REMOVE addmulx, dec16, halflead, halftrail, halves, maxsel, mulmul, negdec, negdiv8,
      negdiv8x.
